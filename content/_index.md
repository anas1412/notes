## Welcome to the Edge

This book is for anyone who seeks true masteryâ€”in their career, relationships, or personal growth. It's for those who understand that genuine, sustainable success isn't found in external indicators or fleeting strategies, but in the profound transformation of one's inner world.

Here, you will find insights forged in the crucible of high-stakes personal experience, challenging conventional wisdom and offering a transformative path to profound fulfillment. Your journey into the inner game begins with the pivotal moment that led me to write these notes, detailed in the first chapter.
