## And so, you've arrived at the end.

There's nothing left for you here. No more chances. No more encouragement. You've made your choice.

Imagine this: You're on your deathbed, the final moments ticking away. The room is quiet, save for the faint hum of medical equipment. And then, they appear. Not angels, not demons, but the ghosts of your unlived lives. The person you could have been, vibrant and alive, stands beside the dreams you never pursued, now faded and dusty. The talents you let wither, the adventures you never dared to embark upon, the love you never risked. They look at you, not with anger, but with profound, heartbreaking disappointment. Their eyes, once filled with the fire of possibility, are now hollow, reflecting the emptiness of your choices. They are the silent witnesses to the potential you squandered, the masterpiece you left unpainted, the symphony unheard. A cold dread washes over you as you understand that this is not a nightmare, but the stark, unchangeable reality of a life unlived. The silence in the room is deafening, filled only with the echoes of 'what if' and 'if only'. And in that moment, you realize the true cost of your inaction: not just what you lost, but who you failed to become.

This is the misery you've earned. This is the emptiness you chose.

There is no one left to save you. This is your final exit. Are you absolutely sure?
