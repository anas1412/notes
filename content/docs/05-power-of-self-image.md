Before we delve into the transformative Be-Do-Have model, it's crucial to understand the foundational role of your self-image. Your self-image is the mental picture you have of yourself – your beliefs about who you are, what you're capable of, and what you deserve. It's the blueprint that dictates your actions and ultimately, your results.

> "Man cannot consistently act beyond what he believes himself to be."
— Maxwell Maltz, Psycho-Cybernetics

If you perceive yourself as incapable, unworthy, or unlucky, your actions will unconsciously align with that belief, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Conversely, a strong, positive self-image empowers you to take bold actions and persist through challenges, because you inherently believe in your capacity to succeed. Cultivating a healthy self-image is the first step towards truly embodying the 'Be' in the Be-Do-Have model. It's like the rider clearly visualizing the horse's strength and capability, and the horse, in turn, sensing the rider's confidence and responding in kind.
