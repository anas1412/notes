Greetings, Seeker. You embark on a journey, much like a rider on a quest, seeking truths beyond the familiar horizon. These are 'Notes from the Edge'—insights gleaned from venturing beyond the well-trodden paths of conventional wisdom. This collection challenges ingrained beliefs and offers a transformative path to profound and sustainable fulfillment. We will explore fundamental paradigms that govern our pursuit of goals: Have-Do-Be, Do-Have-Be, and the ultimate destination, the Be-Do-Have.

> "The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes."<br>— Marcel Proust
