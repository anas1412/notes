> "The only way that we can live, is if we grow. The only way we can grow is if we change. The only way we can change is if we learn. The only way we can learn is if we are exposed. And the only way that we can be exposed is if we throw ourselves out into the open. Do it. Throw yourself out."<br>â€” C. JoyBell C.
