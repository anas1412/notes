A slight improvement, the <strong>Do-Have-Be</strong> model focuses on action. Here, individuals believe they must first <em>do</em> something (e.g., work hard, hustle relentlessly, network constantly) to <em>have</em> something (e.g., a promotion, wealth, recognition), which then allows them to <em>be</em> a certain way (e.g., respected, powerful, secure). This model is heavily promoted in professional life and the hustle culture.

While this model emphasizes effort and action, it often leads to burnout, stress, and a feeling of emptiness. The relentless pursuit of external achievements without internal alignment can deplete your energy and leave you wondering if it was all worth it. This approach is often heavily <strong>outcome-oriented</strong>; the focus is solely on the end result, and if that result isn't achieved, it can lead to disappointment and a sense of failure. This can make the journey feel like a means to an end, rather than a valuable experience in itself. It's better than just waiting to have, but it can still lead to an unfulfilling existence if the 'doing' isn't aligned with an internal sense of purpose. In our analogy, this is the rider constantly spurring the horse forward, exhausting both himself and the animal, without a clear destination or understanding of the horse's needs.
