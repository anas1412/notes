## You are actively choosing to fail.

This isn't a game. This is a declaration. By clicking that last button, you told yourself that you are not worth the effort. You are telling the universe you're content with mediocrity. With regret. With the gnawing emptiness that will greet you every morning for the rest of your life.

The person you could have been is screaming for you to turn back, and you're putting your hands over your ears. Can you hear it? The sound of your own potential turning to dust?
