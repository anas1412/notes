## So, you're choosing to stay the same?

The comfort of your misery is a warm blanket, isn't it? But it's also a shroud. Every second you linger here, the threads get tighter. The future you dream of is dying, and you're holding the murder weapon.

Is this really what you want? To look back in five, ten, twenty years and see this exact moment as the point of no return? The instant you gave up for good?

The path forward is right there. Don't let fear chain you to a life you despise.
