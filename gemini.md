## Hugo Book Theme Configuration Reference

This section provides key configuration details for the Hugo Book theme used in this project. For comprehensive documentation, refer to the [official Hugo Book theme GitHub repository](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

### `hugo.toml` Configuration

```toml
baseURL = "https://anas1412.github.io/notes/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Notes"

[module]
  [[module.imports]]
  path = "github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book"

[params]
  BookTheme = 'auto' # Switches between dark and light modes based on browser/OS preferences
  BookToC = true     # Controls table of contents visibility on right side of pages
  BookRepo = 'https://github.com/anas1412/notes' # Set source repository location for 'Last Modified' and 'Edit this page' links
  BookSection = 'docs' # Specifies section of content to render as menu

[markup.tableOfContents]
  startLevel = 1
  endLevel = 6 # Ensures all heading levels are included in the Table of Contents
```

### Page Front Matter Configuration

These parameters can be specified in the front matter of individual Markdown pages (`.md` files) within the `content/docs/` directory:

```toml
# Set type to 'docs' if you want to render page outside of configured section or if you render section other than 'docs'
type = 'docs'

# Set page weight to re-arrange items in file-tree menu.
weight = 10 # Used for ordering chapters in the sidebar menu

# (Optional) Set to 'true' to mark page as flat section in file-tree menu.
bookFlatSection = false

# (Optional) Set to hide nested sections or pages at that level. Works only with file-tree menu mode
bookCollapseSection = true

# (Optional) Set true to hide page or section from side menu.
bookHidden = false

# (Optional) Set 'false' to hide ToC from page
bookToC = true

# (Optional) If you have enabled BookComments for the site, you can disable it for specific pages.
bookComments = true

# (Optional) Set to 'false' to exclude page from search index.
bookSearchExclude = true

# (Optional) Set explicit href attribute for this page in a menu.
bookHref = ''
```

### Custom SCSS for Numbered Headings

To enable numbered headings in the main content, the `assets/_custom.scss` file is used to import the `_numbered.scss` plugin:

```scss
@import "plugins/numbered";
```

## Book Structure and Consistency Guidelines

This section outlines the structural and thematic guidelines applied to the "Notes from the Edge" book to ensure consistency, professionalism, and a compelling reader experience.

### Overall Narrative Flow

*   **`_index.md` (Welcome Page):**
    *   **Purpose:** A concise, inviting landing page that sets the stage for the book.
    *   **Content:** Brief introduction to the book's core themes (mastery, inner game, unconventional success) and a clear directive to start with the "Introduction" chapter. Includes the Table of Contents.
*   **`introduction-the-riders-quest-to-the-edge.md` (Introduction: The Edge of Disgust):**
    *   **Purpose:** The primary hook for the reader.
    *   **Content:** Starts with a powerful, relevant quote. Features the author's personal, high-impact story (the software engineering experience) as the catalyst for the book's journey. Introduces the core "Rider and Horse" analogy and the book's universal premise (mastering the inner game for general life success, using trading as a compelling example).
*   **Core Chapters (`content/docs/*.md`):**
    *   Each chapter follows a consistent, structured approach (detailed below).
    *   Focuses on a specific concept, paradigm, or skill.
    *   Leverages the "Rider and Horse" analogy to explain internal dynamics.
    *   Includes both universal examples and personal high-stakes examples (from trading or other relevant experiences).
*   **`conclusion-the-edge-of-transformation.md` (Conclusion: The Path Forward):**
    *   **Purpose:** Summarizes the book's journey and provides a forward-looking call to action.
    *   **Content:** Reaffirms the core message of inner mastery leading to fulfillment. Includes a powerful, relevant quote (different from the introduction's). Inspires the reader to apply the learned principles in their own lives.

### Consistent Chapter Structure (for Core Chapters)

Each chapter (excluding `_index.md` and the main `introduction`) adheres to the following seven-part structure to ensure clarity, engagement, and actionability:

1.  **Introduction to the Concept:**
    *   Briefly introduce the main idea, paradigm, or skill the chapter will cover.
    *   Hook the reader and state the chapter's purpose.
2.  **Explanation & Deep Dive:**
    *   Elaborate on the concept. Provide definitions, theoretical background, and break down complex ideas into understandable parts.
    *   Answer the "what" and "how" of the concept.
3.  **The Rider & Horse Connection:**
    *   Explicitly link the chapter's concept back to the "Rider and Horse" analogy.
    *   Explain how this concept impacts the dynamic between your conscious mind (Rider) and subconscious/body (Horse). This reinforces the book's central metaphor.
4.  **Universal Application / General Example:**
    *   Provide a relatable, everyday example that illustrates the concept for a broad audience (e.g., learning a new skill, managing a project, personal relationships). This shows the concept's universal relevance.
5.  **Personal Experience / High-Stakes Example (Your Story):**
    *   This is where the author's unique perspective comes in. A specific, vivid example from the author's trading journey, or another high-stakes personal experience, is used to demonstrate the concept in action.
    *   Explains how this concept played out for the author, the challenges faced, and the lessons learned. This grounds the theory in real-world application and maintains an authentic voice.
6.  **Actionable Insights / Practical Application:**
    *   Translates the concept into concrete steps or actionable advice for the reader.
    *   Focuses on how the reader can apply this in their own lives, regardless of their specific field.
    *   Highlights key takeaways.
7.  **Chapter Summary & Transition:**
    *   Briefly summarizes the main points of the chapter.
    *   Provides a smooth transition to the next chapter, hinting at what's to come and how it builds on the current topic.

### Thematic Consistency

*   **Rider and Horse Analogy:** Consistently used throughout the book to explain the interplay between conscious and subconscious processes.
*   **Universal Applicability:** While leveraging personal trading experiences, the language and examples are generalized to resonate with a broad audience seeking personal mastery in any field.
*   **Focus on Inner Game:** The overarching theme is the importance of internal transformation for external success and fulfillment.
*   **Professional Tone:** Maintains a professional, insightful, and encouraging tone throughout.
