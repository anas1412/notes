I learned this lesson not in a book, but in the soul-crushing reality of a life I was told I should want. I was in a paid software engineering post-internship, finishing my university years to graduate. I remember the feeling of anticipation, waiting for a salary that felt more like an allowance.

That was the moment the desire for freedom became a non-negotiable demand. It started as a quest for time freedom, which I quickly realized was impossible without financial freedom.
