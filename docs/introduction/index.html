&ldquo;The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.&rdquo;
— Joseph Campbell
For years, I chased what I was told was success. I poured my passion, my intellect, my very essence into building, optimizing, creating. I was in a paid software engineering post-internship, on the cusp of graduating university, brimming with the naive belief that hard work and demonstrable value would be rewarded.
I automated their entire backup system, slashing deployment times by a staggering 80%. I streamlined the onboarding process for new developers, transforming a week-long ordeal into a seamless day or less. I delivered, I innovated, I believed in the work."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="https://anas1412.github.io/notes/docs/introduction/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Notes"><meta property="og:title" content="Introduction: The Edge"><meta property="og:description" content="“The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.” — Joseph Campbell

— Joseph Campbell</p></blockquote><p>For years, I chased what I was told was success. I poured my passion, my intellect, my very essence into building, optimizing, creating. I was in a paid software engineering post-internship, on the cusp of graduating university, brimming with the naive belief that hard work and demonstrable value would be rewarded.</p><p>I automated their entire backup system, slashing deployment times by a staggering 80%. I streamlined the onboarding process for new developers, transforming a week-long ordeal into a seamless day or less. I delivered, I innovated, I <em>believed</em> in the work.</p><p>And what was my reward? The last three months of my already meager salary went unpaid. The final, soul-crushing blow came when the CEO, fresh from a heated dispute with the sales team—a conflict entirely unrelated to my work—stormed into our office and unleashed a torrent of undeserved fury directly at me, for a trivial, manufactured issue.</p><p>In that moment, something inside me snapped. It wasn&rsquo;t just disappointment; it was a profound, visceral disgust. Disgust at the injustice, at the betrayal, at the realization that my passion, my dedication, meant nothing in a system that valued control and ego over contribution. I looked at the lines of code, the automation scripts, the very tools I once adored, and felt a chilling hatred for them. My love for coding, for creation, was poisoned.</p><p>That was my edge. That was the moment the desire for freedom became a non-negotiable demand. It started as a desperate quest for <strong>time freedom</strong>, which I quickly realized was impossible without <strong>financial freedom</strong>. And the ultimate expression of that, for me, was <strong>location freedom</strong>—the ability to live and work from anywhere in the world, on my own terms.</p><p>Trading became one such vehicle, but it quickly exposed a deeper truth: any high-stakes environment, be it the market, a demanding career, or a personal challenge, is merely a mirror, reflecting our own internal state. My biggest enemy wasn&rsquo;t a bad setup; it was a moment of fear, a surge of greed, or a lapse in discipline—universal struggles that transcend any specific field.</p><p>This is why these &lsquo;Notes from the Edge&rsquo; exist. They are the answer to the question that drove me from that cubicle: How do you master the inner game to achieve true, fulfilling success, on your own terms?</p><p>This collection challenges the conventional wisdom that leads to burnout and dissatisfaction. We will explore the fundamental paradigms that govern our lives, using a powerful analogy to guide us: your conscious mind is the <strong>Rider</strong>, and your subconscious is the <strong>Horse</strong>. This book is about training the Horse so the Rider can finally steer towards the life you actually want.</p><p>Your journey to the edge begins now.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div></main></body></html>
