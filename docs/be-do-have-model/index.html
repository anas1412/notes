Begin by being the person you need to be to achieve your goals. This involves cultivating the mindset, beliefs, values, and identity of someone who already embodies what they desire. For example, if you aspire to be a successful entrepreneur, start being confident, resourceful, resilient, and innovative right now. This is about internal alignment and self-perception. This internal shift is often rooted in faith or trust (whether in oneself, the universe, or a higher power). It&rsquo;s the belief that by focusing on who you are becoming and taking aligned action, the desired outcomes will manifest. For many, this faith extends to a belief in God, providing a profound sense of peace and assurance that their path is divinely guided, and that challenges are opportunities for growth. In the analogy, this is the rider cultivating an unshakeable belief in his ability to guide the horse, and the horse, sensing this conviction, responds with trust and cooperation.'><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="https://anas1412.github.io/notes/docs/be-do-have-model/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Notes"><meta property="og:title" content="15.

<a class=anchor href=#be>#</a></h3><p>Begin by being the person you need to be to achieve your goals. This involves cultivating the mindset, beliefs, values, and identity of someone who already embodies what they desire. For example, if you aspire to be a successful entrepreneur, start being confident, resourceful, resilient, and innovative right now. This is about internal alignment and self-perception. This internal shift is often rooted in faith or trust (whether in oneself, the universe, or a higher power). It&rsquo;s the belief that by focusing on who you are becoming and taking aligned action, the desired outcomes will manifest. For many, this faith extends to a belief in God, providing a profound sense of peace and assurance that their path is divinely guided, and that challenges are opportunities for growth. In the analogy, this is the rider cultivating an unshakeable belief in his ability to guide the horse, and the horse, sensing this conviction, responds with trust and cooperation.</p><h3 id=do>DO
<a class=anchor href=#do>#</a></h3><p>Once you are being that person, the doing naturally flows from your authentic self. Your actions will be aligned with your new identity and internal state. This is where the principle of burning the bridges becomes paramount. There is no Plan B. A backup plan is a subconscious admission of doubt that pollutes your commitment. By focusing all your energy on a single path, you signal to your subconscious mind that failure is not an option. This unwavering focus, fueled by a healthy obsession, is the essence of powerful action. A confident and resourceful entrepreneur does market research, does network strategically, and does take calculated risks with conviction because there is no other way forward.</p><p>This approach encourages process-oriented thinking. While outcomes are important, the primary focus is on the journey of becoming and the actions taken along the way. It&rsquo;s about enjoying the learning, the growth, and the daily steps. When you are process-oriented, you find joy and fulfillment in the present moment, and the outcomes become a natural byproduct of a well-executed process. This approach fosters resilience, as setbacks are seen as part of the learning process, not as definitive failures. In the analogy of the man and his horse, this is the rider consistently training and guiding the horse, focusing on each step of the journey, knowing that consistent effort will lead them to their destination.</p><h3 id=have>HAVE
<a class=anchor href=#have>#</a></h3><p>Finally, as a direct and inevitable result of being the right person and doing the aligned actions, you will have the desired outcomes. The success, the wealth, the fulfilling relationships, the vibrant health – these are the natural consequences of embodying the person you need to be and and taking inspired action. This model emphasizes attracting what you desire through internal congruence, rather than endlessly chasing external validation. In the analogy, this is the harmonious arrival at the destination, a natural outcome of the rider&rsquo;s clear guidance and the horse&rsquo;s willing cooperation.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#be>BE</a></li><li><a href=#do>DO</a></li><li><a href=#have>HAVE</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
