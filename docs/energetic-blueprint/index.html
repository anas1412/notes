This intricate interplay forms a dynamic internal &lsquo;blueprint&rsquo; that shapes how we perceive and interact with the world. Understanding this fundamental principle is key to consciously shaping your reality.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."— Nikola Tesla</p></blockquote><p>Underlying all these models is our fundamental mindset. Are we operating from a place of fear or faith/trust? Fear-based thinking often drives the Have-Do-Be and Do-Have-Be models. We fear not having enough, not being good enough, or not achieving external markers of success. This fear can lead to anxiety, constant striving, and a feeling of never being truly satisfied.</p><p>In contrast, operating from a place of faith or trust (whether in oneself, the universe, or a higher power) aligns more with the Be-Do-Have model. It&rsquo;s the belief that by focusing on who you are becoming and taking aligned action, the desired outcomes will manifest. This doesn&rsquo;t mean passive waiting, but rather a confident and purposeful engagement with life, knowing that your efforts are guided and supported. This faith, when coupled with a healthy obsession, transforms mere effort into an unstoppable force, propelling you towards your goals with unwavering conviction. For many, this faith extends to a belief in God, providing a profound sense of peace and assurance that their path is divinely guided, and that challenges are opportunities for growth. In the analogy, this faith is the rider&rsquo;s unwavering belief in his ability to guide the horse, and the horse&rsquo;s trust in the rider&rsquo;s direction, even when the path is uncertain.</p><p>This understanding profoundly impacts your mindset. A scarcity mindset is characterized by a persistent focus on perceived limitations, fear, and competition. This cognitive pattern can trigger physiological stress responses, narrow attentional focus, and lead to behaviors such as hoarding, a reluctance to collaborate, and chronic anxiety about resources or missed opportunities. In this state, your internal system is primed to detect and reinforce perceived lack.</p><p>Conversely, an abundance mindset fosters a state of gratitude, generosity, and collaboration. This cognitive and emotional orientation promotes neural pathways associated with positive affect and open-mindedness, leading to behaviors such as freely sharing knowledge, celebrating the successes of others, and confidently pursuing new ventures. This mindset cultivates an internal environment conducive to recognizing and attracting opportunities.</p><p>Your emotions are powerful indicators of your current internal state. Chronic engagement with emotions like shame, guilt, apathy, grief, fear, and anger can lead to sustained physiological stress responses and reinforce limiting cognitive biases. In contrast, cultivating emotions such as courage, neutrality, willingness, acceptance, reason, love, joy, peace, and enlightenment promotes states of well-being and cognitive flexibility. To shift towards more adaptive internal states, cultivate practices like mindfulness, daily gratitude, positive affirmations, acts of selfless service, and spending time in nature. These practices consciously influence your neurochemistry and cognitive patterns, fostering an internal environment aligned with growth and opportunity. This conscious cultivation of your internal blueprint is a vital component of the &lsquo;Be&rsquo; in the Be-Do-Have model, allowing you to attract your desired reality by first embodying it internally.</p><p>In the analogy of the man and his horse, this &rsquo;energetic blueprint&rsquo; is akin to the overall &lsquo;mood&rsquo; or &lsquo;disposition&rsquo; of the horse, which is heavily influenced by the rider&rsquo;s (your conscious mind&rsquo;s) consistent guidance and internal state. A rider who constantly projects fear and scarcity will find his horse anxious and resistant, prone to stumbling or shying away from challenges. Conversely, a rider who embodies confidence and abundance, consistently guiding him with clear, positive intent, will find the horse responsive, powerful, and eager to move forward, even through unfamiliar terrain. Your conscious choices as the &lsquo;rider&rsquo; directly shape the &lsquo;horse&rsquo;s&rsquo; (your subconscious and physiological responses) readiness to navigate the journey of manifestation.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div></main></body></html>
